# Calculator

A simple, user-friendly calculator web application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project demonstrates the basic functionality of a calculator, along with a clean and responsive design.

# Features
* Clean and intuitive user interface
* Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
* Responsive design for mobile and desktop
* Clear button to reset the calculator
* Error handling for invalid operations

# Technologies Used
* **JavaScript**: Implements the core calculator logic and handles user interactions
* **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web application
* **CSS**: Styles the application for a better user experience

# How It Works
* The calculator interface is presented to the user with a display screen and buttons for digits (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /).
* Users can click on the buttons to input numbers and operations, which are displayed on the screen.
* The calculator processes the input and displays the result when the equals (=) button is pressed.
* The clear (C) button resets the display and allows for a new calculation.
