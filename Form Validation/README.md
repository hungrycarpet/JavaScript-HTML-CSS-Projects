# How It Works
1. **User Interface**:
    * The main interface presents a sign-up form with fields for username, email, password, and confirm password.
    * Each field is designed to provide visual feedback based on the validity of the input.

2. **Entering User Information**:
    * Users input their username, email address, password, and confirm password.
    * As each field is filled out, JavaScript functions validate the input against predefined criteria.

3. **Validation Criteria**:
    * **Username**: Checks if the field is not empty and meets any additional length or character requirements.
    * **Email**: Validates the email format to ensure it follows standard email conventions.
    * **Password**: Ensures the password meets the required complexity, such as length and character types.
    * **Confirm Password**: Verifies that the confirm password field matches the password field.

4. **Visual Feedback**:
    * Valid entries are highlighted with a green border, indicating that the input meets the requirements.
    * Invalid entries are highlighted with a red border, signaling that the user needs to correct the input.
